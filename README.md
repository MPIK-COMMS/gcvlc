# gcvlc
This plugin implements a gaze-controlled VLC player. It can be used with the Pupil Labs Capture software. Just copy vlc.py, myvlc.py, AND gcvlc.py into the plugin folder of Pupil Labs Capture. The VLC player has to be installed on your computer!

## gcvlc on Windows
If you are running a Ubuntu computer this plugin should work right out of the box (tested under Ubuntu 16.04). However to use the gaze-controlled VLC player under Windows you have to copy all .dll files and the plugin folder  inside of the VLC folder (e.g. C:\ProgramFiles\VideoLAN\VLC) into your Pupil Capture folder.
